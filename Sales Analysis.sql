-- Sum the quantity ordered column
SELECT sum(quantity_ordered)
FROM sales;

-- ANSWER: The total number of sales is 209079.

-- What are the average sales per month?

-- Group total sales by month from highest to lowest
SELECT month, sum(total_per_row) AS sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY month

-- ANSWER: December had the highest sales at $4 613 443 whle January had the lowest at $1 822 256. 
-- Other months averaged between two to three million in sales. 

-- Which state generated the most sales on average?

SELECT state, sum(total_per_row) AS avg_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY avg_sales DESC;

-- ANSWER: California (CA) had the most sales on average with a total of $13 714 774. 
-- The next closest state (New York, "NY") only had $ 4 664 317 in average sales for comparison.

FROM sales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY number_sold DESC;

-- ANSWER: The USB-C Charging Cable and Lightning Charging Cable (complement products to the google phone and iPhone respectively) are sold the most at 21903 and 21658 times respectively. 
-- Batteries and headphones are also very popular, being sold around 13325 to 20641 per model. 
-- Next closest product has only been sold 7507 times

FROM sales
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY sales DESC;

-- ANSWER: The city with the highest sales is San Francisco with sales of $8 262 203, over two million higher the next city, Los Angeles. 

-- What products are most often sold together? 

-- Select two products and the amount of times (count) they were sold together
SELECT
  a.product AS product_a,
  b.product AS product_b,
  count(*) AS sold_together
-- Perform a self join on the sales table (based on matching order_id) as we are comparing rows from this table
FROM sales AS a
JOIN sales AS b ON a.order_id = b.order_id
-- This condition ensures unique pairs (otherwise there would be the same two products but in a different order)
AND a.product < b.product
-- Group the orders of both products and display the best selling pairs
GROUP BY a.product, b.product
ORDER BY sold_together DESC;

-- ANSWER: The two most common pairs of products bought together are "iPhone and Lightning Charging Cable" being bought together 1015 times and "Google Phone and USB-C Charging Cable" being bought together 999 times. 
-- Next closest pair is bought 462 times together (iPhone and Wired Headphones).

FROM sales
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY frequency DESC;

-- Time ranges of 11-13 (11am to 1pm) and 18-20 (6pm to 8pm) would also be great time ranges to advertise in (average of over 12000 products bought per hour).
